## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling (to build the project)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - Webiste deployment

### What I learned

I learned basics of TypeScript, how to type things, as well as using it with Vue3.

### Continued development

I'm going to keep using TypeScript and Vue3 to get better with it.
